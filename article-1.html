                                <h4 class="mb-0">Why the pandemic made some cats sick with stress?</h4>
                                <div class="mb-1 text-muted">May 08</div>
                                <p class="card-text mb-auto">Those of us who own pets probably enjoyed their company in
                                    the depths of the pandemic. Not only are pets potentially good for our physical
                                    health, they also benefit our mental wellbeing. Indeed, they may have even been a
                                    way of coping with pandemic-fuelled mental health problems.</p>
                                <p class="card-text mb-auto">But this is still an emerging area of research, so the
                                    impacts of pet ownership on human health aren’t always clear cut. Recent research
                                    suggests that having to care for a pet during the pandemic could actually have
                                    compromised our quality of life – including how satisfied we are with our health,
                                    lifestyle and relationships.</p>
                                <p class="card-text mb-auto">In the same way, how we interact with our pets and how we
                                    choose to manage them might inadvertently be causing them stress, too. While some
                                    family pets may have enjoyed their owners spending a lot more time with them than
                                    usual, there have been reports that some cats were less enamoured with these changes
                                    to their routine – even reportedly becoming sick from the stress of their owners
                                    being home all the time. So how do these dynamics work and is there anything we pet
                                    owners can do to minimise them?</p>
                                <p class="card-text mb-auto">Affectionate but independent
                                    Those of us less enamoured with domestic cats might see them as a bit aloof, or cold
                                    and calculating. We might assume that cats are less interested in us or aware of our
                                    feelings compared to dogs, for example.</p>
                                <p class="card-text mb-auto">But cats are actually capable of being highly sociable with
                                    humans and are probably picking up on a lot more than many people give them credit
                                    for. For example, cats are able to recognise their own names and are sensitive to
                                    the emotional expressions of their owners. Cats may also be negatively impacted by
                                    our personalities, with anxious and depressed owners linked to greater stress in
                                    their cats.</p>
                                <p class="card-text mb-auto">Cats have potentially also mastered the subtle art of human
                                    manipulation within their purrs by embedding a “cry” sound within them. Scientists
                                    think they use this sound to tap into our care-giving instincts, just like human
                                    infants do. Indeed, cats are capable of producing a broad range of different
                                    vocalisations to express themselves – though we might not necessarily understand
                                    them.</p>
                                <p class="card-text mb-auto">Yet while cats can certainly develop positive relationships
                                    with humans, they’re not born with an innate desire for human company and must be
                                    sufficiently handled when young. As adults, some cats are much more sociable than
                                    others – though even friendly cats prefer people that allow them to dictate the
                                    nature of their interactions. Not stroking them too much can even increase their
                                    levels of affection and reduce aggression.</p>
